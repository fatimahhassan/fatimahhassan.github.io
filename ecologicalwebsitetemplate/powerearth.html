Its primary estate is nestled along the main road at Tanah Rata, about 2km before town or 6km after <a href="http://www.cameronhighland.net/ringlet.htm" target="_parent">Ringlet</a>. This particular plantation has two tea houses situated slightly apart from each other along the main road, but only the first has a proper pathway that leads down the tea fields for visitors to explore. The second tea house, however, has a much larger car park next door to alleviate traffic during peak tourist season. Both centers feature a product shop and open-air cafe with impressive views of the valley.</div></td>

Their first line of tea products were stamped with the 'Chop Rusa' brand; this later evolved into the present Cameron Valley badge marketed throughout Malaysia. Today, Bharat Tea offers some special tea blends inspired by Sri Lankan and South Indian flavours, such as Masala Chai and Cardamom Tea that each have a spizy zing. The cafes offers an eclectic blend of continental and local food, including scones, brownies, doughnuts and cheese cakes to traditional local pastries such as curry puffs, sandwiches with spicy sardine paste filling and 'Nasi Lemak' - a light meal of rice with sambal sauce and anchovies wrapped inside a bundle of banana leaves. Bharat Tea is open daily; from 9am to as late as 6pm on busy days.</div></td>
