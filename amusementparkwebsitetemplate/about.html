		  <p>
								<b>Big Red Strawberry Farm, also known as Taman Agro Tourism, is an agricultural center growing strawberries and organic salad-based vegetables on a steep hill slope overlooking Brinchang town center. Accessible by a backdoor route from Star Regency Hotel (signboards along the main road, same direction as Cactus Valley), the farm is one of Brinchang's most popular tourist attractions, featuring a large cafe, product shop, vegetable market and strawberry picking. Open daily from morning till evening, entrance is free but visitors driving personal vehicles need to beware the steep road incline both when entering and exiting back to Brinchang.</b>

							<h3>Brinchang night market</h3>
							<p>
								The Night Market is a popular shopping attraction among visitors that occurs every Friday and Saturday in Brinchang town, starting from early evening till late night. Known locally as 'Pasar Malam', this weekend bazaar occupies tarmac clearings on both sides of the main road slightly north of town in the direction of Kea Farm, opposite Star Regency Hotel. Similar to the daily market at Kea Farm, native products of Cameron Highlands are sold abundantly, including strawberries, vegetables, fruits, tea blends, ornamental plants and colouful souvenirs. The Night Market is also a culinary adventure - a tantalising exhibit of hawker stall food from different cultures across Malaysia.
